* ESG criteria are used to screen investments based on corporate policies and to encourage businesses to act responsibly.
* Many mutual funds, brokerage firms, and robo-advisors now offer ESG-compliant investment products.
* When companies engaged in risky or unethical practices are held accountable, ESG criteria can also help investors avoid investment losses.
* The recent rapid growth of ESG investment funds has given rise to allegations that companies have been dishonest or misleading in touting their ESG achievements.
